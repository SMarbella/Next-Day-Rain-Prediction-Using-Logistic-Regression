# Next Day Rain Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Data Information
This project comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia from 2007 to 2017. I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to perform logistic regression to predict next-day rain in Australia. It explores features that increase the likelihood of rain in Australia and predicts whether or not it will rain tomorrow.

# Charts and Calculations Generated For This Project

## Jupyter Notebooks Libraries
I imported the common libraries used for Jupyter Notebook. The pandas library is an open-source tool for data analysis and manipulation in Python. It reads files and creates Dataframes and Series. The NumPy library works with arrays and performs mathematical calculations. The Matplotlib library is used to generate graphical representations of data in Python. The Seaborn library provides statistical data visualization. The Sklearn library includes tools I need for machine learning and making predictions based on data.

# Data Cleaning
I created a DataFrame in Python using Pandas and read the data into it. I displayed the number of rows and columns. The raw data table has 143460 rows and 23 columns. I chose to include 9 columns into the analysis since I do not need all the columns.

I checked each column for NULL values and dropped them. I included a comparison that shows the table with its NULL values and after I removed its NULL values. This time, the cleaned table has fewer columns. It shows that all columns have no NULL values.

# Data Exploration
I compared the number of rainy days to dry days. Australia is mostly a dry country.

I split the dataset into feature_set and target_set. The feature_set includes WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Temp9am, and Temp3pm. The target_set includes the RainRomorrow column. I converted the RainTomorrow values into their mapped numeric variables. Using the Seaborn library, I cerated a pairplot. The plots visually compare all the columns included in feature_set. RainTomorrow color codes the likelihood of rain.

I imported the train_test_split function from the Sklearn library and split the data into training and testing sets. I imported confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay, LogisticRegression, and accuracy_score from the Sklearn library to measure the accuracy of my logistic regression. I instantiated a logistic regression machine learning model. I fit the logistic regression machine learning model with my data. I used the test dataset to forecast tomorrow's rain. When I assessed my model's performance, its accuracy score is 0.8305474452554744, meaning that it is quite accurate in predicting raining conditions. The model correctly predicts 83% of the rainy forecasts based on the weatherâ€™s possible combinations of features. I created a confusion matrix to map its accuracy. The upper-left and bottom-right corners of the confusion matrix are accurate predictions. They are false negatives (not rainy tomorrow) and true positives (rainy tomorrow).

# Summary
First, I imported the CSV file from Kaggle into my Jupyter Notebooks repository. I imported pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn libraries to gain access to machine learning and data visualization tools. I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to perform logistic regression to predict next-day rain in Australia. It explores features that increase the likelihood of rain in Australia and predicts whether or not it will rain tomorrow. 

I dropped the columns I do not need and focused on 9 columns for analysis. I removed NULL values from the columns.

I split the dataset into feature_set and target_set. Data exploration shows that Australia is mostly a dry country. It has fewer rainy days than sunny days. I used a pairplot from Seaborn to visually explore the data and show how the feature_set columns affect each other, increasing or decreasing the chance of rain the next day. I split the data into training and testing sets for a logistic regression machine learning model. I fit the model into my data and assessed my model's performance. Since Australia mostly has a stable, dry weather, my model correctly predicted 83% of rainy weather forecasts.
